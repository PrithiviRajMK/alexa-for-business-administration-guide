In addition to public Alexa skills, developers can use the Alexa Skills Kit to publish skills privately to Alexa for Business organizations without the need to certify or have the skill available with all other Alexa skills\. 

**To build private skills**
+ For information about how to build private skills, see [Build Skills with the Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html)\.
**Note**  
If you are building a private skill and want to use any information from a shared device that requires permission, follow the instructions in the Alexa Skills Kit\. For more information, see [Permissions](https://developer.amazon.com/fr/docs/devconsole/build-your-skill.html#permissions)\.
